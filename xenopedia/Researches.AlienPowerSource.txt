<desc>Despite only being the size of a household fridge, the power unit recovered from the UFO still produces enough energy to power a city the size of New York. Surprisingly, however, the device proved utterly inert once switched off - not even appearing to radiate heat.&#10;&#10;The construction of the device is equally peculiar. It consists of a cylindrical outer casing of alien ceramics, the interior of which is dotted with hundreds of tiny laser emitters. Sitting inside this is a rotating inner casing that is packed with a lattice of unidentified yellow crystal, again cylindrical in shape. The origin and composition of these crystals has yet to be determined, but there is no question that they form the heart of the reactor. For want of a better name, my team have dubbed the material &quot;Alenium&quot; and are in the process of removing the lattice from the casing to allow further study. Preliminary scans suggest that there is an almost incomprehensible amount of energy stored within these Alenium crystals, despite the lattice being no larger than a football. This material is potentially one of the greatest discoveries of recent times; we should begin research on it immediately.&#10;&#10;The rest of the power source contains little of interest. All of the materials used in its construction have been encountered in larger quantities elsewhere in the hulls of recovered UFOs and the machinery itself is not overly complex; studying it has yielded nothing worth commenting upon. The only mystery surrounds the sea of identical laser emitters covering the interior of the outer coating - we are as yet unaware of their purpose. Studying a couple of examples have provided only minor advances in our understanding of laser technology, mostly in the areas of beam focusing and miniaturisation of optical amplifiers. I very much doubt that the aliens are unable to produce far more powerful laser emitters, suggesting that they have deliberately been designed to only emit low intensity beams. We would be interested to know the significance of this with regards to the Alenium lattice; it may give us an avenue of research when we begin to study it.&#10;&#10;Finally, I understand you have received a request (from personnel in a department which will remain nameless) seeking to prevent me from dismantling such devices inside the base in future. I must object to the repeated usage of the phrase &quot;reckless disregard&quot; and I can assure you I am no more keen to end my life in an enormous fireball than anyone else in this base. I therefore request you tell the staff concerned to stick to what they know (i.e. building things, making unintelligible grunting noises)...</desc>

<cdesc>虽然尺寸只有家用冰箱大小，这个在UFO上发现的能量单元依然可以释放出足以驱动纽约规模城市的能量。但让人吃惊的是，一旦把它关掉这个设备还是非常稳定的－甚至不会向外界散发热量。&#10;&#10;这个装置的构造也非常奇特。圆柱形的外星陶瓷外壳，外壳内部排列着几百个极小的激光发射器。内部是一个旋转的内壳，包裹在不明的黄色水晶构成的晶格中，形状也是圆柱形。水晶的起源和组成还没有确认，但毫无疑问它们来自反应堆的核心。为了给它一个更好的名称，我的团队将这种材料命名为&quot;Alenium&quot;我们正在移除这些Alenium水晶。尽管晶格只有橄榄球大小，但初步的扫描显示这些Alenium水晶中储存着惊人的能量。这种材料有可能是近期最重要的发现之一；我们应该立即着手对其进行研究。&#10;&#10;能量源的其他部分则没有什么研究价值。制造它的其它材料都已经在UFO的船体中大量发现，机械方面并不是特别复杂；对其的研究没有值得评论的成果。唯一的不明之处围绕在外壳内层海量的激光发生器上－我们还没有找到它们的用途。对几个样本的研究只让我们对激光的认识有微小的进展，大部分在光束聚焦和光学放大器的小型化上。我不认为外星人无法制造更强大的激光发生器，这说明它们有意图的只生成低密度的激光束。我们对Alenium晶格的重要性非常有兴趣，对它的研究可能为我们的研究指明方向。&#10;&#10;最后，我理解你已经（从秘密部门的人）那里收到了阻止我以后在基地里拆解类似设备的要求。我必须对一个反复提及的用词提出抗议&quot;不管不顾&quot;我可以向你保证，我没有比基地里的任何一个人希望在一个巨大的火球里结束生命。所以我建议你告诉职员干好自己的工作（建造东西，发出不知所云的噪声）…</cdesc>
