<desc>As improving our plasma technology to the point where it surpassed that of the aliens would be virtually impossible, new ideas were needed. They arrived in the form of old ideas. MAG weapons are electromagnetic coilguns that combine the remarkable properties of alien materials with our existing knowledge of ballistic weapons.&#10;&#10;The idea behind a Gauss gun / coilgun has been around for over a century and consists of a series of electromagnets firing sequentially, accelerating a projectile along the barrel of the weapon to deadly speeds. The parallels with alien plasma weapons should be obvious - but while the plasma technology uses the electromagnetic acceleration as a means to an end, a coilgun uses it as a means in itself. The technology can be adapted from existing plasma weapon designs and has some significant advantage, e.g. an energy projectile does mostly thermal damage and can be partially absorbed / reflected / dissipated by a number of factors, atmospheric conditions included. A spot of rain will not offer much protection against a metal pellet travelling at five times the speed of sound.&#10;&#10;MAG weapon prototypes have been built in Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle and Precision arrangements, each one small enough to be carried by an infantryman but still capable of delivering a pellet of alien alloy at hypersonic speed. They are almost certainly the most powerful terrestrial infantry weapons that will ever exist - pushing muzzle velocity any higher would raise air resistance highly enough to explosively ignite the air behind the projectile (likely killing the soldier firing the weapon). It seems we are now limited by the composition of our atmosphere rather than by our technology. </desc>
<cdesc>虽然我们的等离子技术在改善，但是实际上超越外星人是不可能的，需要有新的思路，有趣的是它们会以旧的形式出现。MAG 武器是一种把外星材料的出色特性与我们已知弹道武器技术结合的电磁线圈炮。线圈(高斯)炮的概念已经存在了一个多世纪，这项技术可以将串联的电磁铁从炮筒按顺序发射并加速到致命速度。这与外星等离子武器的相似之处是显而易见的 - 不同之处在于等离子技术采用电磁加速作为一个手段而不是最终目的，而线圈炮则正相反。该技术可以适于从现有的等离子体武器的设计，并有一些显著优点，例如能量抛射主要造成的热损伤可以部分地被吸收/反射，或者受大气条件等不同因素影响。但是雨点在5倍音速飞行的金属弹头面前就显得不堪一击了。MAG 的武器原型已经被制造成手枪，猎枪，步枪和精密布局武器，每一种原型机都足够小到可以由步兵携带，而且仍能够有把外星合金弹头加速到高超音速的能力。这种武器几乎肯定会是现存最强大的陆地步兵武器 - 因为对弹头初速提高的更多会增加空气阻力，造成枪口空气爆燃（甚至可能杀死射击武器的士兵）。看来我们现在受限于我们周围的大气构成，而不是由我们的技术本身。</cdesc>
