<desc>The S-6 &quot;Sentinel&quot; Battlesuit is a combat exoskeleton designed for general combat usage. It offers less protection than our S-2 &quot;Predator&quot; exoskeletons, but incorporates a personal jump unit and is not limited to using only heavy weapons. The helmet also features a unique camera system that allows the wearer 360-degree vision.&#10;&#10;The Sentinel contains thousands of tiny sensors that work to detect and augment the wearer's movement, making it operate more like a second skin than a half-tonne armoured suit.  It is capable of the same dexterity and range of motion as an unarmoured soldier, whilst also providing amplified strength and excellent protection. The helmet contains a full rebreather system (rendering the wearer immune to smoke and gas effects) and a variety of sensors and cameras linked directly to the helmet visor, giving the wearer unparalleled awareness of the battlefield around them. The jump unit does away with the miniaturised jet turbines of the Buzzard and utilises alien antigravity technology instead, resulting in a much more compact device that also contains the suit reactor.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that this level of precision engineering would simply not be possible if the Sentinel were armoured as heavily as the Predator. The more primitive design still excels at soaking up damage and remains our best option for assault work, but the Sentinel is far more versatile in combat. A mixture of the two designs would be a powerful combination; taken together they represent the final word in the development of battlefield protection.</desc>
<cdesc>S-6&quot;哨兵&quot;战斗护甲是针对一般战斗设计的体外骨骼。它的保护能力比S-2&quot;捕食者&quot;突击护甲弱，但是整合了跳跃装备，可以使用重型武器及其他武器。头盔上安装了360度的摄像头，可以提供无死角的视野。&#10;&#10;装甲中还安装了上千个传感器，来采样计算穿戴者的活动，它不仅仅是半吨重的钢铁，反而像是第二层皮肤。它的灵巧性和延展性可以同没穿护甲相媲美，又不妨碍其为士兵增强力量，提供绝佳的保护。此护甲装备了完整的呼吸系统（使穿戴者能免疫外界气体和烟雾的影响），一系列的传感器和摄像头直接与头盔的护目镜相连，为穿戴者提供了无与伦比的战场警觉。跳跃系统没有使用秃鹰跳跃服的小型推进装置，转而使用了外星的反重力技术，使得这个使用了小型反应堆的装备更加小巧紧凑。&#10;&#10;需要指出的是，这种高度精密的工艺制成的护甲不会像捕食者突击护甲那种厚重。原始的装备更擅长吸收伤害，所以依然是突击战斗的最好选择，但是哨兵战斗护甲更能适应一般战斗。这两种设计在战斗中是强有力的组合，代表了战场上，护具的最终发展。</cdesc>
