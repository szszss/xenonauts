<desc>The X-37 Corsair is the first aircraft designed specifically for fighting extraterrestrial craft. We have made extensive use of alien materials when designing the airframe and used materials known to be resistant to alien weapons for everything else - producing an aircraft that is faster, tougher and no less agile than our F-17 Condor interceptors. It is not capable of carrying heavy torpedoes, so should complement the Foxtrot rather than replace it.&#10;&#10;In many respects, the design of the craft is evolutionary rather than revolutionary - it is an immense undertaking to design an entire aircraft in such a short time, even for someone as intelligent as myself. Many of the gains have been made by reproducing existing systems using more efficient alien materials / manufacturing techniques, but we have made two main innovations - introduction of a variable-sweep wing design and the new ER-3 Alenium Impulsion reactor / turbine system. The latter produces twice as much thrust as a conventional jet turbine, the former increasing maneuverability at low speed while also increasing performance at high speeds. As a result, the Corsair can cruise at almost 3,000 km/h despite the extra armour making it larger and heavier than its predecessor.&#10;&#10;Construction of each Corsair represents a significant investment of time, money and alien materials, but I have little doubt that conventional aircraft will rapidly become obsolete as the invasion escalates further. </desc>
<cdesc>X-37 “海盗”是第一款专为对抗外星飞船而设计的飞行器。我们将外星人的材料广泛应用于机身结构的设计，并将已知的能够抵抗外星人武器的材料设计到飞行器其他部位——由此制造出一架比我们的F-17 “神鹰”截击机更快、更强且灵活性毫不逊色的飞行器。其并不能用于携带重型鱼雷，因此它更适合与“狐步”形成优势互补而非替代后者。&#10;&#10;这种飞行器在许多方面的设计采用的是循序渐进的创新方式而非革命式的——即便对于我这样聪明的人来说，要在如此短时间内完全重新设计一架飞行器也是无法完成的任务。大多数的改进主要来源于将更有效的外星人材料和生产工艺应用到已知系统的制造中，但我们也的确实现了两项重要的创新——采用可变后掠翼设计和新的ER-3 Alenium Impulsion 反应堆涡轮系统。后者能提供两倍于传统喷射式涡轮的推力，前者在提升低速状态可操控性的同时对高速状态的性能表现亦有助益。因此，尽管“海盗” 的附加装甲使其比前辈更大、更重，但它仍然能够以3000公里的时速进行巡航。&#10;&#10;每建造一架“海盗” 都会耗费相当多的时间、金钱和外星材料，但我坚信，随着未来入侵行动的升级，那些传统的飞行器将很快沦为一无是处的废铁。</cdesc>
